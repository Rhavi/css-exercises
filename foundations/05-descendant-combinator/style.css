[+]heres how to setup the css links[+]
for a basic htm element, notting should be added:
element_name{}

in order to target a class you need a peroid before the name
.class_name{}

to target an Id you need to place a hashtag at the start of the id name
#ID_Name{}

when you want to affect multiple items put a comma between the selectors
element_name, #ID_name{}
this will affect anything with either of these options

when you want to target a specific collection of traits they need to be int he selector field without a comma
element_name .class_name #ID_Name{}
this will target anything that has these options in this order, since its so specific it will supercede other options
